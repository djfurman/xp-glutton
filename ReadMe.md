# Glutton

Ever run a performance test, love the results and then feel disappointed in prod? In my experience this is frequently caused not by incongruant database configuration, but incongruant size.

## Purpose

This project uses the excellent faker library to fill a database to specification with realistic but fake data for preformance purposes.

## Usage

- Run `pipenv install`
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Edit the `.env` file for your configuraiton

## Release Log
